# Apache OpenWhisk runtimes for java

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/apache/openwhisk-runtime-java.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/github/apache/openwhisk-runtime-java)

## Changelogs
- [Java 8 CHANGELOG.md](core/java8/CHANGELOG.md)


## Quick Java Action
A Java action is a Java program with a method called `main` that has the exact signature as follows:
```java
public static com.google.gson.JsonObject main(com.google.gson.JsonObject);
```

For example, create a Java file called `Hello.java` with the following content:

```java
import com.google.gson.JsonObject;

public class Hello {
    public static JsonObject main(JsonObject args) {
        String name = "stranger";
        if (args.has("name"))
            name = args.getAsJsonPrimitive("name").getAsString();
        JsonObject response = new JsonObject();
        response.addProperty("greeting", "Hello " + name + "!");
        return response;
    }
}
```
In order to compile, test and archive Java files, you must have a [JDK 8](http://openjdk.java.net/install/) installed locally.

Then, compile `Hello.java` into a JAR file `hello.jar` as follows:
```
javac Hello.java
```
```
jar cvf hello.jar Hello.class
```

**Note:** [google-gson](https://github.com/google/gson) must exist in your Java CLASSPATH when compiling the Java file.

You need to specify the name of the main class using `--main`. An eligible main
class is one that implements a static `main` method as described above. If the
class is not in the default package, use the Java fully-qualified class name,
e.g., `--main com.example.MyMain`.

If needed you can also customize the method name of your Java action. This
can be done by specifying the Java fully-qualified method name of your action,
e.q., `--main com.example.MyMain#methodName`

Not only support return JsonObject but also support return JsonArray, the main function would be:

```java
import com.google.gson.JsonArray;
import com.google.gson.JsonObject;

public class HelloArray {
    public static JsonArray main(JsonObject args) {
        JsonArray jsonArray = new JsonArray();
        jsonArray.add("a");
        jsonArray.add("b");
        return jsonArray;
    }
}
```

And support array result for sequence action as well, the first action's array result can be used as next action's input parameter.

So the function would be:

```java
import com.google.gson.JsonArray;

public class Sort {
    public static JsonArray main(JsonArray args) {
        return args;
    }
}
```

### Create the Java Action
To use as a docker action:
```
wsk action update helloJava hello.jar --main Hello --docker openwhisk/java8action
```
This works on any deployment of Apache OpenWhisk

To use on a deployment of OpenWhisk that contains the runtime as a kind:
```
wsk action update helloJava hello.jar --main Hello --kind java:8
```

### Invoke the Java Action
Action invocation is the same for Java actions as it is for Swift and JavaScript actions:

```
wsk action invoke --result helloJava --param name World
```

```json
  {
      "greeting": "Hello World!"
  }
```

## Local development

### Pre-requisites
- Gradle
- Docker Desktop (local builds)

### Build  and Push image to a local Docker registry

1. Start Docker Desktop (i.e., Docker daemon)

2. Build the Docker runtime image locally using Gradle:
```
./gradlew core:java8:distDocker
```
This will produce the image `whisk/java8action` and push it to the local Docker Desktop registry with the `latest` tag.

3. Verify the image was registered:
```
$ docker images whisk/*
REPOSITORY           TAG     IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
whisk/java8action    latest  35f90453905a        7 minutes ago       521MB
```

### Build and Push image to a remote Docker registry

Build the Docker runtime image locally using Gradle supplying the image Prefix and Registry domain (default port):
```
docker login
./gradlew core:java8:distDocker -PdockerImagePrefix=$prefix-user -PdockerRegistry=docker.io
```

## Deploying the Java runtime image to OpenWhisk

Deploy OpenWhisk using ansible environment that contains the kind `java:8`
Assuming you have OpenWhisk already deployed locally and `OPENWHISK_HOME` pointing to root directory of OpenWhisk core repository.

Set `ROOTDIR` to the root directory of this repository.

Redeploy OpenWhisk
```
cd $OPENWHISK_HOME/ansible
ANSIBLE_CMD="ansible-playbook -i ${ROOTDIR}/ansible/environments/local"
$ANSIBLE_CMD setup.yml
$ANSIBLE_CMD couchdb.yml
$ANSIBLE_CMD initdb.yml
$ANSIBLE_CMD wipe.yml
$ANSIBLE_CMD openwhisk.yml
```

Or you can use `wskdev` and create a soft link to the target ansible environment, for example:
```
ln -s ${ROOTDIR}/ansible/environments/local ${OPENWHISK_HOME}/ansible/environments/local-java
wskdev fresh -t local-java
```

### Testing
Install dependencies from the root directory on $OPENWHISK_HOME repository
```
pushd $OPENWHISK_HOME
./gradlew install
popd $OPENWHISK_HOME
```

Using gradle to run all tests
```
./gradlew :tests:test
```
Using gradle to run some tests
```
./gradlew :tests:test --tests *ActionContainerTests*
```
Using IntelliJ:
- Import project as gradle project.
- Make sure working directory is root of the project/repo

#### Using container image to test
To use as docker action push to your own dockerhub account
```
docker tag whisk/java8action $user_prefix/java8action
docker push $user_prefix/java8action
```
Then create the action using your the image from dockerhub
```
wsk action update helloJava hello.jar --main Hello --docker $user_prefix/java8action
```
The `$user_prefix` is usually your dockerhub user id.

# Troubleshooting

### Gradle build fails with "Too many files open"

This may occur on MacOS as the default maximum # of file handles per session is `256`.  The gradle build requires many more and is unable to open more files (e.g., `java.io.FileNotFoundException`).  For example, you may see something like:

```
> java.io.FileNotFoundException: /Users/XXX/.gradle/caches/4.6/scripts-remapped/build_4mpzm2wl8gipqoxzlms7n6ctq/7gdodk7z6t5iivcgfvflmhqsm/cp_projdf5583fde4f7f1f2f3f5ea117e2cdff1/cache.properties (Too many open files)

```
You can see this limit by issuing:
```
$ ulimit -a
open files                      (-n) 256
```

In order to increase the limit, open a new terminal session and issue the command (and verify):
```
$ ulimit -n 10000

$ ulimit -a
open files                      (-n) 10000
```

### Gradle Task fails on  `:core:java8:tagImage`

Docker daemon is not started and the Task is not able to push the image to your local registry.
